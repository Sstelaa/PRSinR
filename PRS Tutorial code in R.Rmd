```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


    SOOOO, Reading in the height.gwas
    
> library(data.table)
> dat <- fread("Height.gwas.txt.gz") 
# copy it into R directory first
> result <- dat[INFO > 0.8 & MAF > 0.01]
# filters SNPs for MAF and imputation score [INFO]
> fwrite(result, "Height.gz", sep="\t")


    Target data QC after PLINK
    
> dat <- read.table("EUR.QC.het", header=T) # Read in the EUR.het file, specify it has header
m > <- mean(dat$F) # Calculate the mean  
> m
[1] 0.003034763
> s <- sd(dat$F) # Calculate the SD
> s
[1] 0.0138189
> valid <- subset(dat, F <= m+3*s & F >= m-3*s) # Get any samples with F coefficient within 3 SD of the population mean
> write.table(valid[,c(1,2)], "EUR.valid.sample", quote=F, row.names=F) # print FID and IID for valid samples
